        <p>The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains.
            It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you. <br><br>
            Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and
            their many dozens of moons. Along with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun.
            The Sun is one among hundreds of billions of stars in the
            Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.</p>

        <p>Our planet, Earth, is an oasis not only in space, but in time. It may feel permanent,
            but the entire planet is a fleeting thing in the lifespan of the universe. For nearly two-thirds of the
            time since the universe began, Earth did not even exist. Nor will it last forever
            in its current state. Several billion years from now, the Sun will expand, swallowing
            Mercury and Venus, and filling Earth’s sky. It might even expand large enough to swallow Earth itself.
            It’s difficult to be certain. After all, humans have only just begun deciphering the cosmos.

            While the distant future is difficult to accurately predict, the distant past is slightly
            less so. By studying the radioactive decay of isotopes on Earth and in asteroids, scientists have learned
            that our planet and the solar system formed around 4.6 billion years ago.</p>

            Human understanding of what the universe is, how it works and how vast it is has changed over the ages.
            For countless lifetimes, humans had little or no means of understanding the universe.
            Our distant ancestors instead relied upon myth to explain the origins of everything.
            Because our ancestors themselves invented them, the myths reflect human concerns, hopes, aspirations or
            fears rather than the nature of reality.

            Several centuries ago, however, humans began to apply mathematics, writing and new investigative principles
            to the search for knowledge.
            Those principles were refined over time, as were scientific tools, eventually revealing hints about the
            nature of the universe.
            Only a few hundred years ago, when people began systematically investigating the nature of things, the word
            “scientist” didn’t even exist (researchers were instead called “natural philosophers” for a time).
            Since then, our knowledge of the universe has repeatedly leapt forward.
